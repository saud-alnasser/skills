 * projects of a monorepo can each call an area `auth`. A skill takes one for its
 * notes, so a note is reached from the skill owning it. `policies/`, `agents/`,
 * and `templates/` are flat because none of them namespaces anything: a policy
 * is one file with nothing to sit inside. The gate asks for these depths rather
 * than for a file that merely ends in `.md`, because depth is half of what makes
 * a directory AEP's rather than somebody's own folder of notes.
 *
 * The four protocol directories are here rather than in an arm of their own
 * because every Markdown artifact this release ships under them carries a
 * `use-when`, so the test they need is this one and not one resembling it.
 * That guarantee is weaker for `agents/` and `templates/` than for the rest: a
 * `use-when` is required of a policy, a rule, a reference, and a context, and on
 * those two it is held by the suite instead. Either way the gate stays sound and
