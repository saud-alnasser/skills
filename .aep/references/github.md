# Reference — GitHub

**This file is yours.** Installed because a GitHub remote was detected. Correct
it where this repository differs.

Commands below were checked against `gh` 2.96.0. Where a version here is older,
the gaps are the parts to re-check first.

## Reading

```sh
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,state,labels
gh issue list --state open --limit 50
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,body,state,files
gh pr checks <number>
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef
```

Reading is always allowed. `[[policies/authority]]` still applies: read another
repository freely, write to none.

## Tasks as issues

Where this repository keeps AEP tasks in GitHub Issues rather than under the
effort, **GitHub already models everything a task needs.** Nothing is invented on
top of it and no label is created for a fact the tracker carries itself.

| The fact | Carried by | Never |
| --- | --- | --- |
| which effort this task belongs to | **one issue for the effort, tasks as its sub-issues** | a label, where the hierarchy serves |
| what gates this task | **issue dependencies** — `blocked by` | a `blocked-by-<n>` label |
| open, resolved, obsolete | the issue's **state** and close reason | a status label |
| bug, feature, chore | the issue's **type** | a type label, where types are enabled |

**The effort is an issue, and its tasks are that issue's sub-issues.** The effort
gets a real home in the tracker — a body, a thread, a progress count — and the
shape matches how the set is created anyway: root first, then children.

```sh
gh issue create --title "<effort>" --body-file <file>          # the effort

gh issue create --title "<type(scope): summary>" --body-file <file> \
  --parent <effort-number> --blocked-by <number> --type <name>

gh issue edit <number> --add-blocked-by <number>
gh issue edit <number> --add-sub-issue <number>
gh issue edit <number> --add-label <name>

gh issue close <number> --reason completed     # resolved
gh issue close <number> --reason "not planned" # obsolete
```

**A milestone is the alternative**, and it is worth taking where the repository
already runs efforts as milestones. It filters server-side (`--milestone`), which
the hierarchy does not — but it has no `gh` command to create one, milestones
usually already mean releases here, and an effort is not a release. Sub-issues
cap at **100 per parent and eight levels deep**; past that, the effort was too
big before the tracker said so.

**Creating an issue publishes.** It lands in other people's workspace, so it is
gated exactly as opening a pull request is: write the whole set first — issues,
and anything the resolution needs created alongside them — show it, get it
approved, and only then create. Root first, then children, then the links.

## What the body does, and does not do

Body text is mostly **not** a control surface. One keyword family genuinely
drives GitHub; the rest is convention that other trackers taught people to
expect:

| Written in a body | What GitHub does |
| --- | --- |
| `Closes #123` in a **pull request** | links it, and closes the issue when the PR merges. The full set: `close`/`closes`/`closed`, `fix`/`fixes`/`fixed`, `resolve`/`resolves`/`resolved` |
| `#123` anywhere | a cross-reference in the issue's timeline. Real, but directionless and carrying no meaning |
| `Blocked by #123` | **nothing.** It is prose. Dependencies are set through the UI, the CLI flags, or the API — never parsed out of a body |
| `- [ ] #123` | a checklist item, not a relationship. Tasklist blocks stopped rendering on 30 April 2025 and sub-issues replaced them; converting one is a deliberate action, not a side effect of the syntax |

**The failure this prevents is silent, which is why it is written down.** An agent
that puts *Blocked by #12* in an issue body has recorded the gate nowhere: the
sentence reads correctly to every human who sees it, the tracker knows nothing,
and the frontier query below returns that task as ready to start. Set the edge
with `--blocked-by` or `--add-blocked-by`, where the query can see it.

## Finding the effort, and the frontier

This is the query the task graph is read from, rather than listing every open
issue and judging from prose:

```sh
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 \
  --json number,title,state,blockedBy,parent \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.parent.number == <effort-number>)]'
```

`blockedBy` comes back as the issues gating each one, so **the frontier is
computed, not guessed**: the open issues whose `blockedBy` is empty or entirely
closed. `[[policies/execution]]` requires exactly that — independence read off
declared edges rather than inferred from which files a task looks like it
touches.

**Raise `--limit` deliberately.** There is no server-side filter for a parent, so
`--jq` narrows a page that `gh` has already truncated — the default is 30. A
truncated page filters to a short list that looks like a complete answer, and the
tasks it dropped read as *not in this effort* rather than as *not fetched*. Where
the repository carries more open issues than one page, filter on a milestone
instead, which the server applies before truncating.

The parent's own view is the cheaper read when the edges are not needed:

```sh
gh issue view <effort-number> --json subIssues,subIssuesSummary
```

Other fields `--json` accepts here: `labels`, `milestone`, `issueType`,
`stateReason`, `blocking`.

## Labels, where a label is actually the answer

A label is the last resort, not the first. Before creating one, check in this
order: does GitHub model this natively (the table above), then does a label
already exist that serves the purpose, and only then create.

```sh
gh label list --limit 100          # the whole vocabulary — the default is 30
gh label list --search <term>
gh label create <name> --description <text> --color <hex>
```

**A new label matches the vocabulary already there** — its separator, its
casing, its prefixing. A tracker labelled `area/api` and `type: bug` does not
want `aep:effort/x` beside them. Read the list before naming anything.

## Gaps in `gh`

- **There is no `--parent` filter on `gh issue list`.** The `parent` field comes
  back in `--json` and is narrowed with `--jq`, which filters client-side, after
  truncation — see the limit warning above. `parent-issue:` exists, but it is a
  **Projects** filter and not an issue-search qualifier, so `--search` does not
  reach it either.

- **There is no `gh milestone` command.** Milestones are filtered and assigned by
  `--milestone`, but creating one goes through the API:

  ```sh
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones -f title="<effort>" -f description="<text>"
  ```

  This is the reason the hierarchy is the default and the milestone the
  alternative: creating a parent issue is `gh issue create`, and creating a
  milestone is a drop to the REST API.

## AEP tasks in this tracker

**Draft — this table is the part to correct.** It records what carries each fact
*here*, so no later session has to work it out again. Confirm it once, then it is
read rather than rederived.

| Fact | Carried by | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| effort membership | one issue per effort; tasks are its sub-issues | native |
| the gating edge | issue dependencies | native |
| status | open / closed, with close reason | native |
| — | no AEP label is required on GitHub | — |

Record the effort issue's number where the effort is defined, so the query above
has its `<effort-number>` without a search.

## Referencing a task from a commit

Which form to use is `[[rules/version-control]]`'s, and it depends on how work
reaches the default branch:

```
Refs #123          a reference that closes nothing
Closes #123        only where the commit reaches the default branch through
                   its own branch's pull request
```

A closing keyword in a commit stays live: a later cherry-pick or rebase closes an
issue nobody merged.

## Pull requests

Opening or merging a pull request is the **human's**, never an agent's
(`[[rules/version-control]]`). Prepare the body; do not submit it.

## Failure handling

- `gh` unauthenticated fails with a message naming the login command. Report it;
  do not attempt to authenticate.
- A rate limit is a wait, not a reason to switch to scraping the web UI.
- Issue types and dependencies are newer than much of `gh`; an older binary
  rejects the flag rather than the value. Report the version, do not fall back to
  a label silently.
- An operation not listed here is a gap — say so rather than guessing a flag.
