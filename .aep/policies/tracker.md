use-when: "the repository's version-control rule sets tracker to github or gitlab, and an effort is opened, landed, closed, or abandoned"
---

# Policy — the tracker

Applies only where `tracker:` in `[[rules/version-control]]` is `github` or
`gitlab`. With `tracker: none`, the default, nothing here runs: no issue, no
pull request, no label, no forge call. The effort is a branch a human merges,
and `log.md` is its whole record (`[[policies/execution]]`).

## Two objects per effort

**One issue and one pull request**, and no other tracker object — not per
ticket, wave, or review. Each links to the effort both ways: the effort is
numbered for the issue, and both bodies name the effort's path.

| In the tracker | In the repository |
| --- | --- |
| the issue, whose body is `spec.md` | `spec.md`, `plan.md` |
| the pull request: approach, tickets, a mirror of `log.md` | tickets, `blocked-by` edges, `log.md` |
| labels, projecting those files | — |

- A ticket is never a tracker object, and the dependency graph never leaves the
  repository.
- The tracker is read, never mirrored into `.aep/`. `log.md` is canonical; the
  pull request mirrors it.
- A run that finds an effort short of either object opens what is missing and
  says so.
- A write to shared tracker data is proposed first, with the exact strings.

## Opening

`/specify` asks **once**, before `aep open`, for two things together: permission
to push and open a public pull request, with the exact issue title and body,
branch name, and pull request title; and the effort's `priority:`. A refusal
stops the opening: the draft stays in scratch and nothing is created. Then:
create the issue (each criterion a checkbox), `aep open <slug> --lane <lane>
--number <issue>`, push, and open a draft pull request carrying the approach
and each ticket's criteria as checkboxes, or saying tickets are not cut yet.

The quick lane never uses the tracker.

**The closing keyword's place is the repository's** (`[[rules/version-control]]`).
Merged through a pull request: `Closes #<issue>` in the pull request body,
written at opening, and never in a commit. Stacked: every commit carries
`Refs #<issue>` except the change that merges last, which carries
`Closes #<issue>`.

## While the run works

After each `aep land` and `aep record`, mirror `log.md` into the pull request
and project the ticks. **A failed write is reported, never continued past.**
Every later revision to `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `evidence/`, or `tickets/` is a
`docs` commit, and the issue body is rewritten to match the spec.

## Labels are projections

**The file wins.** Where a label and `spec.md` disagree, correct the label,
never the file.

| | Set | Then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **derived** — `status:`, `type:`, `size:`, every flag a fact establishes | from a file or the diff | re-synced on every write |
| **initial** — `priority:`, any flag inviting a person to act | once, at opening | never changed by an agent |

| The effort | Issue | Pull request | What moves it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the spec is being drafted | `status: backlog` | `status: backlog` | `[[skills/specify]]`, opening both objects |
| the spec is accepted and the tickets are cut | `status: ready` | `status: ready` | `[[skills/specify]]`, on acceptance |
| the runner is working | `status: in progress` | `status: in progress` | `[[skills/implement]]`, on taking the first ticket |
| converge found no gap, and the spec is stamped `implemented` | `status: in review` | `status: in review` | `[[skills/implement]]`, at the close |
| merged | `status: done`, and the pull request closes it | `status: done` | the forge's merge-time job, and `reconcile.mjs` on the next run where none is installed |
| closed without merging | `status: done` | `status: done` | the forge's merge-time job, and `reconcile.mjs` on the next run where none is installed |

- **Flags need a fact:** `breaking changes` from the public-contract trip-wire;
  `dependencies` when a manifest or lockfile moved; `release` when what a
  release publishes moved; `discussion` while the spec has open questions, and
  the human removes it; `triage` on a fresh draft; `confirmed`, `unconfirmed`,
  `cant reproduce` from a diagnosis; `wontfix` when abandoned.
- **`size:` is computed from the diff** at ready-for-review, against the
  thresholds the repository's own label descriptions state.
- **Use labels that already exist here.** Read the list first; a new one matches
  the separator, casing, and prefixing in use, and creating it is reported with
  the reason. No label names AEP.

## Closing

After `aep close`: finalise the pull request body in the shape below, set
`size:`, move both objects to `status: in review`, and mark the pull request
ready — only with every review finding closed. A stop mirrors `log.md` and
leaves the pull request a draft. **Abandoning closes both objects**, labelled
`flag: wontfix`.

The body: the smallest visual that explains the change; before-and-after
evidence; and the merge danger — a one-way or two-way door, and the blast
radius.
