// Answers where a run is, from git alone: which efforts the branch claims,
// which efforts the tree is touching now, which surface the run stands in and
// what role that surface makes it, and what isolation is in force.
//
// AEP says the branch is the claim and nothing ever read it. Which effort an
// invocation was inside came from the human, in the conversation, on every
// invocation. That holds while one session runs at a time, and it stops holding
// the moment a runtime puts one thread per branch in one repository, because
// threads share no conversation and the branch is the only thing telling them
// apart.
//
// The claim is what the branch's own commits changed, measured against the
// merge base with the default branch, rather than what the branch is called.
// Naming belongs to the repository and sometimes to the runtime, which
// generates its own, so a resolution that reads the name answers nothing on the
// runtime this was written for. The name survives as the fallback, because a
// branch with no commits of its own has no other signal.
//
// The claim and the working set are deliberately different questions. Scope
// computed from the working tree can never fire a guard: the first illegal
// write enlarges the scope that would have caught it. Measured from commits,
// the claim is a fact the run cannot edit by misbehaving.
//
// The surface and the role are computed the same way and for the same reason.
// Two agents standing in two surfaces of one effort are bound by opposite rules,
// and neither rule was derivable from anything either agent could read: it lived
// in a brief the run outlives. So the surface is a function of two paths git
// prints, and the role is a function of the surface. Nothing is stored, because
// git already holds the fact and a second copy is a fact that can disagree.
//
// Reported, never enforced. A run that must not integrate is refused by the
// policy keyed on the role, exactly as the isolation is reported here and acted
// on there, so there is one place a reader looks for what a run does about what
// this script found.
//
// This reads git and nothing else. The position marker is a different question,
// whether the tree moved since some earlier run looked at it, and it carries no
// effort identity by design.
